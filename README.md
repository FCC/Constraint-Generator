# Constraint Generator

## Introduction

The TVStudy Data Processing and Constraint Generation (Constraint Generator) software is used to process data produced by the FCC's _TVStudy_ software to create pairwise interference constraint files in the format adopted by the FCC for use in the repacking process of the upcoming broadcast incentive auction.

The Constraint Generator comprises two distinct steps.  First, SQL scripts process raw point data produced by _TVStudy_ to generate a database of pairwise station interference data.  Next, a Java program outputs the constraint files in a specified format using the processed data from the SQL database.

### System Requirements

* **Platforms:** Constraint Generator runs on Mac OS X, Linux, and [Windows](https://github.com/fcc/Constraint-Generator/README.windows.md) platforms.
* **Software Pre-requisites:** [Java Runtime Environment (JRE7)](http://java.com/download), [PostgreSQL 9.3.1](http://postgresql.org/download) or higher, Git, and [_TVStudy_ 1.3.1](http:/..fcc.gov/download/incentive-auctions/OET-69/)

  **Note:** Each run of _TVStudy_ produces over 500GB of data that must be loaded into a robust database.  Once loaded, indexing of data requires additional space.
* **Memory & Processing:** 4GB RAM (recommended) & modern multi-core processor.

### Version

This manual is for Constraint Generator v1.0.0 (Linux/Mac OS X version).  To install Constraint Generator on Windows, please see the [README.windows.md](https://github.com/fcc/Constraint-Generator/README.windows.md) file.

## Installation
1. Download the Constraint Generator software  
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/fcc/Constraint-Generator/
  ```

2. Install PostgreSQL 9.3.1 or higher on your local machine or a robust computer using the default settings.
3. Extract `tvstudyprocessing.zip` to create the `./tvstudyprocessing/` folder.

  ```
  unzip tvstudyprocessing.zip
  ```

## Setting up the Database

### PostgreSQL Setup

1. Connect to the default `postgres` database using the `psql` command line tool, and enter the password configured during installation if prompted
  * **Note:** on some platforms, you may need to edit the `/etc/postgresql/pg_hba.cnf` file or run `sudo -i -u postgres` first if you receive an authentication error when running the psql command.

  ```
  psql -d postgres
  ```

2. At the psql console prompt, create a PostgreSQL user (default: `db_ia_owner`) and set a password (default: `changeme`)  
  
  ```
  CREATE USER db_ia_owner WITH PASSWORD 'changeme';
  ```
  
3. Create a PostgreSQL database `db_ia` for TVStudy data processing  
  
  ```
  CREATE DATABASE db_ia OWNER db_ia_owner;
  ```
  
4. Grant privileges on the `db_ia` database to the user `db_ia_owner`  
  
  ```
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE db_ia TO db_ia_owner;
  ```
  
### Reference Table Setup

**Note:** This step only needs to be run once.

1. Using the terminal, connect to the `db_ia` database as user `db_ia_owner` using the `psql` command line tool (enter the configured password if prompted)  
  
  ```
  psql -d db_ia -U db_ia_owner -h localhost
  ```

2. Create the `ia` schema as the `db_ia_owner`  
  
  ```
  CREATE SCHEMA ia AUTHORIZATION db_ia_owner;
  ``` 

3. Grant additional privileges to db_ia_owner
  
  ```
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ia TO db_ia_owner;
  GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ia TO db_ia_owner;
  ``` 

4. Change the working directory to the base of the `Constraint-Generator` directory (e.g., `/Users/FCC/Documents/Constraint-Generator/`)  
  
  ```
  \cd /Users/FCC/Documents/Constraint-Generator/
  ```

5. Run the SQL code that creates and loads data into all the reference tables  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/reference.sql'
  ```

**Note:** the step above, and all other SQL scripts, expects .csv data to exist in the `./tvstudyprocessing/` folder on the machine running the PostgreSQL database.  Please make sure that you have downloaded and extracted the `tvstudyprocessing.zip` file to this folder.

## TVStudy Output Data Processing

In order to use this code to process _TVStudy_ output data, you must run the _TVStudy_ software 8 times using the following specific sets of channel replications:

* Channel 2, 3, 4
* Channel 5, 6, 33, 34, 35, 36 
* Channel 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
* Channel 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
* Channel 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
* Channel 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32
* Channel 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44
* Channel 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51   

To replicate TV Stations onto specific channels using the FCC's _TVStudy_ software, please follow the [TVStudy instructions](http:/..fcc.gov/download/incentive-auctions/OET-69/).

**Note:** These steps must be run each time you would like to generate constraints from different _TVStudy_ runs.  Given the volume of data, the processing typically takes at least 5â€“8 hours.

1. Move `stations.csv` `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 02-04 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch0204/` folder.

2. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 05-06 & 33-36 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch05063336/` folder.

3. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 07-13 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch0713/` folder.

4. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 14-20 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch1420/` folder.

5. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 21-26 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch2126/` folder.

6. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 27-32 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch2732/` folder.

7. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 38-33 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch3844/` folder.

8. Move `service.csv` and `interference.csv` from the Channel 45-51 _TVStudy_ run to the `./tvstudyprocessing/ch4551/` folder.


### Process the TVStudy Output Data
**Note:** It is very important to move the _TVStudy_ output .csv files to the correct `./tvstudyprocessing/` subfolders.  All code references the locations in those subfolders.

1. Using the terminal, connect to the `db_ia` database as user `db_ia_owner` using the `psql` command line tool (enter the configured password if prompted)  
  
  ```
  psql -d db_ia -U db_ia_owner -h localhost
  ```
  
2. Change the working directory to the base of the `Constraint-Generator` directory (e.g., `/Users/FCC/Documents/Constraint-Generator/`)  
  
  ```
  \cd /Users/FCC/Documents/Constraint-Generator/
  ```

3. Run the SQL code that conducts the initial processing of data to determine the baseline interference-free population of each station  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/initial.sql'
  ```

4. Once the previous step is complete, run the SQL code to process the Channel 02-04 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch0204.sql'
  ```

5. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 05-06, 33-36 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch05063336.sql'
  ```

6. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 07-13 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch0713.sql'
  ```

7. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 14-20 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch1420.sql'
  ```

8. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 21-26 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch2126.sql'
  ```

9. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 27-32 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch2732.sql'
  ```

10. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 38-44 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch3844.sql'
  ```

11. Next, run the SQL code to process the Channel 45-51 data  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/ch4551.sql'
  ```

12. Finally, run the SQL code that conducts the final processing to merge all intermediate pairwise interference tables into a single table  
  
  ```
  \i 'scripts/final.sql'
  ```

* It is possible to parallel process Steps 3-12 by opening multiple psql console connections (assuming you have adequate computing resources)
* The SQL code is written in such a way that each piece of code is committed during execution (rather than doing a single commit into the database at the completion of the script).
* The code is written in such a way that if you run Steps 3-12 a second time, it will delete the previous tables.  
* If processing of a particular script is interrupted or fails, it is safe to simply re-run the .sql script that failed (this will not cause any issues with previously completed .sql scripts)   
* If you wish to keep previous runs of TVStudy output please make to export a CSV of the previous result or rename the table, for example by running this command in psql:  
  
  ```
  ALTER TABLE ia.tvsoftware_pairwise_result_final RENAME TO tvsoftware_pairwise_result_final_oct2014
  ```
